      MontyHacks is an entirely student run event hosted by the Montgomery Computer Science Club in partnership with YECNJ.
      It is located at Montgomery High School in Skillman, New Jersey and is running for the third time this year.
      We have wonderful mentors and speakers that will guide you along the way and hopefully help you build something great!
      Students of all experience levels are welcome! <br> <br>
      MontyHacks III's theme is Dual Nature, the crossroads of Health and Artificial Intelligence. There is so much
      opportunity to innovate and design new and amazing things with the combination of healthcare and AI, and we want
      our hackers to discover just how rich the field is. Come to MontyHacks and broaden your horizons!
